# Library for working with console

This library can be used to create application with console UI. It supports:

* colors
* text positioning
* keyboard events handling

Implementation uses:

* `conio.h` and `wincon.h` on Windows
* `ncurses.h` on Unix-based OS

### Using

Just copy `console.h` and `console.c` to your project and use them:

    #include "console.h"

That's all for Windows.

On Unix-based OS you should also have
[ncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html) library installed.

For example, use apt-get on Linux:

    apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Or use your favourite package manager on your favourite OS.

After this add `-lncurses` to gcc options of your project.

### Example

There is an `example.c` which can be useful to understand using of this
library.

To build and run on Windows just compile all files together.

On Unix-based OS it's easy too:

    make && ./example
